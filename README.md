**Benjamin Golubâ€™s** research in economic theory focuses on social and economic networks. His work has examined:

* Learning and gossip: what are the dynamics of information in networks? Who is particularly influential? When do agents learn correctly? When are their beliefs polarized?
* Coordination in organizations: how do strategic agents in complex organizations coordinate, and how do the networks that connect them matter?
* Financial contagion: which financial networks are particularly sensitive to sudden breakdowns?
* Public goods and externalities: in complex favor-trading problems such as pollution reduction, we can use a network perspective to understand how much scope for cooperation there is, who is particularly essential to it, and how to organize negotiations.
 
Since 2015, he has been an Assistant Professor at the Harvard Department of Economics, and prior to that he spent two years as a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows. He was educated at Stanford (Ph.D. in economics) and Caltech (B.S., mathematics).
